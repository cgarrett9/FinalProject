## Family

I have two sisters and a brother, who happens to be my identical twin. My brother and one of my sisters also attend the University of Missouri, so choosing schools wasn't a difficult decision.

### Pets

I also have two dogs and two cats. I have a Border Collie named Patchi, who you can see below, and a Chocolate Lab named Juno. My two cats are named Fitz and Ralph.
