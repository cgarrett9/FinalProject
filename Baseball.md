## Baseball

One thing I couldn't live without is would be baseball. Whether it is playing or watching it, I never get bored of it. 
I played baseball back in high school and these days you can find me watching St. Louis Cardinals Baseball.
I spend most nights watching the Cardinals, as I have been a fan for well over 15 years.
