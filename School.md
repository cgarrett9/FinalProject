## School

As I said before, this is my second semester here at the **University of Missouri**, and my first semester in the *Information Technology* program.
Before transfering to the University of Missouri, I studied two years at St. Charles Community College. I am excited about the next few semester here at Mizzou and achieving my goal of completing a bachelor's degree.
