Final project for IT 1000
 
For my final project in IT 1000, I want to share a bit about myself

My name is Christopher Garrett, and this is my second semester here at Mizzou. Though I have not attended any classes in-person this semester, I am excited to get back to school next semester. There are plenty of things I would like to share about myself.
